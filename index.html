    <h1>How Did I Decide on This?</h1>
    <P>"David, I have to create a web page and I can't think of what I want to write about."
        "Why don't you write about how you adopted your beautiful son.""You know I had already thought
        already thought about that." Obviously great minds think alike.

    </P>
    <h1>"He's So Lucky"</h1>
    <p>I can't speak for other parents who have gone thru the adoption process but this is one 
        statement that I don't particularly care for. Let me give you the short list of the process.
        <ul>
            <li>PATH classes</li>
            <li> Criminal background check</li> 
            <li>Home inspection</li>
            <li>Physical</li>
            
        </ul>
        Can someone explain to me what part luck played in this? Also, there were eight (if I remember correctly)
        other families waiting in line to adopt and we were chosen. So if there was any "luck" involved it 
        befell to us, not him.

    </p>
