<h1>How Did I Decide on This?</h1>

<body>
    <P>"David, I have to create a web page and I can't think of what I want to write about."
        "Why don't you write about how you adopted your beautiful son.""You know I had already thought
        already thought about that." Obviously great minds think alike.

    </P>
    <h1>"He's So Lucky"</h1>
    <p>I can't speak for other parents who have gone thru the adoption process but this is one 
        statement that I don't particularly care for. Let me give you the short list of the process.
        <ul>
            <li>PATH classes</li>
            <li> Criminal background check</li> 
            <li>Home inspection</li>
            <li>Physical</li>
            
        </ul>
        Can someone explain to me what part luck played in this? Also, there were eight (if I remember correctly)
        other families waiting in line to adopt and we were chosen. So if there was any "luck" involved it 
        befell to us, not him.

    </p>
     <h1>"We Have a Son"</h1>
     <p>Our should I say we're caring for a male child who is a ward of the state. Once a child has
         been placed in your home you probably think that's the end. Actually you're somewhat on 
         probationary status where for a minimum of six months you are "fostering" your child. You 
         have to get approval for what doctor you can take them to. You're subject to regularly
         scheduled home visits from the social worker. I casually mentioned to the social worker during
         our plans to take our son to Little Rock, Arkansas for Christmas to visit my family. Her response
         "Okay, I'll issue you a travel letter." I had forgotten I had to get permission to take him
         out of state. Due to several missteps and mishaps our "fostering" lasted 21 months.
