    <h1>How Did I Decide on This?</h1>
    <P>"David, I have to create a web page and I can't think of what I want to write about."
        "Why don't you write about how you adopted your beautiful son.""You know I had already thought
        already thought about that." Obviously great minds think alike.

    </P>
    <p>Adoption is a long,time consuming,invasive process. At least it was when my husband and I 
        went thru it. You have to complete a ten week course called PATH which stands for Parents 
        As Tender Healers. This a prerequisite for fostering/adoption. You have to have a criminal background check.
        And you have to disclose your financial records.
